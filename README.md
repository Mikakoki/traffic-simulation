# traffic-simulation
Through This project I am working on different traffic models. I start from the simplest forms and try to go on as much as I can. 
you should know that Im a student myself, so please check the codes before using them. if you find any mistakes i would be very happy if you inform me.
the main source of the code is from a course in coursera. you can find them in the link below:
